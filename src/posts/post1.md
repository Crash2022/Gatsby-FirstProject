# Travel to Alpes

**The Alps are a range of mountains in Europe** caused by uplift in the European Plate as it is impacted by the African 
Plate moving north; they stretch from Italy through France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, and into Slovenia.
The highest peaks in Europe outside of the Caucasus Mountains are located in the Alps. Mont Blanc (4,810 m), 
Dufourspitze (4,634 m) and the world-famous Matterhorn (4,478 m) are well known alpine four-thousanders.
Many areas of the Alps are covered by eternal snow and ice. The largest glaciers are located in the Valais and Bernese 
Alps of Switzerland. The Aletsch Glacier with its 23 km length and 900 m depth is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and Liechtenstein are often referred to as the alpine countries because much of their 
territories are geographically and culturally dominated by the alps. The regional provinces of Bavaria, (Germany) and 
South Tyrol (Italy) also offer a distinctly Alpine flair.
